Hello and welcome to my basic web scraper! 

Steps to get started:

- Open command line, change directory to this folder.
- Make sure Python is installed on your device. You can run this command to verify your version: python --version
- Run the command from a command line: pip install -r "requirements.txt" (This installs are libraries required.)
- Add your URLS to the urls array in params.py and choose a keyword or phrase to focus on then add it to stringParam. This is useful for scraping data from multiple sources for a desired topic.
- Run the scraper.py file in your code editor or from the command line with: python scraper.py
